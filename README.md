## Inspiration
The inspiration for creating QmCast came from my desire to get full details about different countries and regions.

## Technical Challenges
This project was a significant technical challenge for me, especially since it involved data structure and manipulation. Some of the key challenges I faced included:

- **Getting Country Data:** Lot of API are very technical to get the right data needed for the program. I spent a lot of time studying tutorials, reading articles, and experimenting with different approaches.
- **Getting the A{I to work** Ensuring API call get response and manage error so program won't crash.

## Timeline and Development
Here's a brief timeline of the project's development:

1. **Week 1:** Initial planning and research. Studied ray casting and set up the project structure.
2. **Week 2:** working with HTML and CSS and getting right information.
3. **Week 3:** Graphical user Interface implementation.
4. **Week 4:** Getting Api to work properly.
5. **Week 5:** Testing and editing, and prepared for deployment.

## Future Vision
I want to make the following improvement to the game:

- **Responsive Design:** Make program responsive to any device screen.
- **Add chart:** Add chart to improve user experience on web page.
- 
## Algorithm Details
The core algorithm behind the Maze Game is ray casting. Here's a detailed explanation of how it works:

1. **API** This made me retrieve data from server to feed webpage.
2. **DOM manipolation:** Editing and manipulation webpage elements and attributes.
